1. Tried creating table on RF, IDFA, AAID data copied earlier. Table creation failed on the data because of a corrupt compressed files. Trying to investigate the issue.
2. Recopied the  RF, IDFA, AAID to hdfs
4. Created table for @lin.chen's analysis - raw_cduid_407_mobid_lr - query is in progress will let you know the structure of the table.
5. Completed level 2 for Pubmatic side query (exploded cduid parameter). All uids are for a single impression are in different rows. Will figure out how to combine them in level 3.
~~~
25 Sept
1. Could not run any jobs on saturday because of the benchmark query running on the cluster.
2. Creation of 'raw_cduid_407_mobid_lr' completed, for mobile device id.
3. Resolved the corrupted file issue with RF,IDFA,AAID.
4. Liveramp side tables for RF, IDFA, AAID are liveramp_rfuid_407, liveramp_idfa_407, liveramp_aaid_407.
5. Pubmatic side data will be cleaned  (To convert it into useable format) in 2 more steps. Of which 1 is in progress.
6. Will run the first analysis after completion of above task. Will provide ETA after running the query.
~~~
26 Sept:
1. Step one of  Pubmatic side data  cleaning took longer than expected. 
2. So, triggered the 2nd query in the morning (IST) today. Mappers completed, trackers 71%.
3. Should take around 2 hours to complete, then we can start with Rocket fuel analysis.
4. Will start with this first 'PubMatic ID is present but no RF ID and LiveRamp has the user details for RF'.
5. Should take 12+ hours to run. But, will update the exact time once I get the mapper/reducer consumption data.
6. ETA will change with the numbers of queries running in the cluster. (edited)
~~~
27 Sept:
1. First analysis from Liveramp Rocketfuel completed.
2. We have '47354115' impressions for which
    a. Pubmatic Uid is present
    b. We do not have uid for Rocket fuel.
    c. We have Liveramp id.
    d. And that Liveramp id has one or more Rocketfuel ids Mapped to it

New Request:
1. what about how many mobile app impressions that we could find a cookie id for
2. we need to understand the lift in the number of impressions that we identified via LR for RF.   So we will need Total no. of impression for a day, how many we had a match for and how many did LR provide a match for. Similarly, for Tapad and Neustar. please share all the numbers
~~~
Oct 3:
To highlight few delay causing factors we discussed -
Other parallel queries
Unexpected query failures
No estimation for join queries, as no such queries were fired before. (Can only be estimated once the query starts running)
~~~
Oct 4:
1.Total Impressions : 37919704260
2. Match rate for Mobile app is 1736601 impressions (Liveramp - RF)

Lin Chen [10:55 PM] 
hey Akshay, let me summarize what data points we need for identify the lift (which is based on the first analysis you did)
-  Which date was it you run the analysis against?
- Is that ‘47354115’  impression include mobile impression? In other words, is “1736601” number included in “47354115"?
- On that same day, Total impressions Pubmatic send to RF a day?
- On that same day, Total mobile impression Pubmatic send to RF a day?
In this way, we can identify the actual lift we are going to see against RF

Akshay Dagade [11:03 PM]

2. Yes
3 and 4. I think pubmatic - RF match rate will help you with the lift.

example: Lets say Pubmatic had a match rate of 100Mn impressions with RF, you can add 47354115 to it to get the total match rate. Let me know if this works.

Dinesh Kandhari [11:06 PM] 
@akshay.dagade: Isn't 37919704260 low for the impressions we received in a day? Do we know how many bid requests did we send to RF on the same day?
~~~
Oct 5
1. Following is the match rate count for Pubmatic - Rocketfuel
    desktop    9404444862
    mobile app    88379565
    mobile web    2460950313
2. Uploaded Media Math data to hdfs
3. Uncomressed MM data.
4. Ran Liveramp-MM analysis
    a. Pubmatic Uid is present
    b. We do not have uid for MM.
    c. We have Liveramp id.
    d. And that Liveramp id has one or more MM ids Mapped to it.
    Last stage still running
5. Ran a query to get number of impressions where we sent bids to RF, MM etc (Level 1 - Full day).
~~~
Oct 6:
1.    We have following impression distribution 
        it    count
        ds    15268966
        ma    96955
        mw    3204389
    where,
        a. Pubmatic Uid is present
        b. We do not have uid for MM.
        c. We have Liveramp id.
        d. And that Liveramp id has one or more MM ids Mapped to it        

2.    We have following impression distribution 
        it    count

Oct 10:
1.These are the impression count where we sent bids to RF, MM, TTD broken down by platform.
(Attached data for number of impressions in which we sent bids to RF,TTD,MM)

2. I ran a query to pull liveramp device id analysis as dicussed with @manjari.sharda.
However, the query was stuck for more than 17 hours. Not sure why.
I have rerun the analysis. (First stuck query)

~~~
Oct 11:
Update:
1. Ran Liveramp app analysis fro MM and RF, query stuck for for that 17 hours at 99%.
2. Same happened during the rerun. Will investigate furtur into it.
3. Ran a query for Pubmatic-TTD/MM match rate.
4. All data pulled till date is available in below xls.
5. Tapad uids are not logged into cduid parameter. Will check this with engineering team.
6. Regarding, mobile app I tried other presto cluster, but I am having issues even there. Trying to resolve it

Ashim Ghosh [9:45 AM] 
In case of Tapad's syncup flow, the PM UID <-> Tapad Cluster UID is provided though Tapad's cross device graph.

~~~
Oct 12:
1. synced up with Ameya regarding mobile id issue but had no luck with the solution.
I will today ping him again for the assistance.
2.I have got pubmatic -dsp sync up count for TTD and MM.
3. And regarding tapad data, it is not very easy to process in its raw format. 
4. Can we ask them for the data in a tablular csv/tsv format like liveramp. And, in many cases i do not see pubmatic uid in their graph. 
5.Attached updated file with Pubmatic-dsp match rate
6. Figured a way to parse tapad file
7. But the files are incorrect

New Request:
These were the 3 pub ids - 37855, 137711, 154037
when we did this this test on 3 publishers, I think you worked on it, we saw a 10% increase

Hi @manjari.sharda,
We are waiting for the data from Tapad, as discussed over the email with them on friday.
And, I will ask for the update from @ameya.kulkarni today.

~~~

Akshay Dagade [8:23 PM] 
Yes, will provide an update today. Ameya has suggested a solution, will try that out and post the update 
(Did not work sent out an email next day)

Hi Team,
This is regarding the mobile app analysis, 
After serveral attempts the query is not working for the analysis. 
I have looped in Ameya and few people form this channel. 
For everyone's reference, attaching the email here.

2.
Tapad newfiles came in, but incorrect

3.
Akshay Dagade [6:04 PM] 
Hi Ameya,
The issue is not resolved yet.
I tried reducing the data set, but the last reducer always freezes. 
Refer the following pig script, where I used a join between a very small data set.

1.
Recieved correct Tapad files

Reply from Ameya
Hi Akshay,
It seems to be an issue with the way the table is set and the volume of records ( ~4BN ) in both tables.
Please can try creating an external hive table and add partitions similar to how other tables are present.
Let me know if that does not work
~~~
26 Oct:
Hi Ameya,
I have attached the implementation of the external table as well as the query.
Following is the app id:
application_1502886522713_409442

The job is still stuck at 99%, even after using the external table.

Ran a skewness query to test skewness as Kunal U suggested.
Pinged the details, waiting for his reply
